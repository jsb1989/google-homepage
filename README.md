# google-homepage
My first project learning from the odin project.
The first challenge is to reproduce the google homepage, minus the functinality of the links working and search engine working.
If you notice the change in background color of the homepage to black it is due to my google homepage having dark mode turned on..
Some Skills used:
  css
    -changed background color of entire page
    -changed background color of specific elements
    -learned to position specifi elemts where I wanted them on the page
    -used hover to change the look of an element, such as links that only will be underlined when hovered over(eg. text decoration, )
    -learned how to include a google font on the page, the google lettering was imported from googles font page
    -created a search form, text links as well as a link using a shape(circle in the top right corner)
    -changed the cursor to either a pointer or text when hovered over a certain element
  html
    -div,img,body,head
